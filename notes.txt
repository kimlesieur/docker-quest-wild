Problem with CRA and Websocket : 
The websocket port seems to be harcoded to 3000.
Since our Docker container is exposing the port 8080, the browser
hot reloading isn't working. 

--> Fix can be to set a new port for websocket ? 
I tries defining a .env file and set WDS_SOCKET_PORT=8080
but doesn't seems to work. 
Should I configure a third librarie to set environment vars ?
